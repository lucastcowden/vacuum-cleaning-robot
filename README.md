For this project, I used Bayes Nets and policy/value iteration to allow an automated vacuum cleaning robot to determine what room it is in, as well as plot a series of actions that
would give it the best chance of moving to another target room. From this project I learned about probabilistic AI, Bellman-Ford updates, and policy/value iteration, as well as how this applies to robot systems.
